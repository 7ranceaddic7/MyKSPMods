*** Definitions ***

	[Atmospheric Pressure] is measured in Atmospheres(Atm) where vacuum is 0 and 1 is the atmospheric pressure on Kerbin at Sea Level.

	[iSP] is the efficiency of the engine, it's a real fancy number made out of science and math, and is measured in seconds (don't ask, math).

	[slope] specifies the slope of the curve at that point; the first specifies the slope coming from the left, the other specifies it coming from the right. This can be used to specify the curve more exactly with fewer inputs.
