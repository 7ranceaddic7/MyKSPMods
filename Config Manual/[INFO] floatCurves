	What is a floatCurve? Its a wrapper around a Unity Animation Curve. Essentially, its a way to describe an arbitrary line on a 2d graph using a few points rather than a formula.

	Unity Animation Curves are a type of spline (cubic Hermite splines, I'm informed) and you can think of it as unity threading something that behaves like a stuff, springy steel cable through the points you set.

	This lets you do things like describe how the playback volume of a sound should change with the throttle, or how a wheel's steering should change with speed, in a nonlinear way using only a few lines in a text file, and without complex maths.


*** Examples ***

velocityCurve
{
    key = 1000 0 0 0
    key = 850 0.2 0 0
    key = 0 1 0 0
}


emission = 0.0 0.0
emission = 0.05 0.0
emission = 0.075 0.25
emission = 1.0 1.25


atmosphereCurve
{
    key = 0 370
    key = 1 320
}


Tangents

	In its most basic form, each point on a floatCurve will operate in 'Free' mode, where Unity fits a spline to the entire curve making it a single smooth, unbroken line.

	However, that can cause your curve to behave differently than you expect it. If that curve is driving the thrust of an engine, or the steering of a wheel, or the length of a rocket's flame, it could look very very wrong, and you'll be scratching your head trying to fix it and adding tons of points to the curve trying to disciple it.

	Thankfully, you don't need to do that.

	A little known fact about points on a floatCurve is that they can take 2 optional parameters, in-tangent and out-tangent, that describe the angle of the curve as it enters and leaves the point.


*** Description of Curve ***

torqueCurve
{
    key = 0 250
    key = 3.35 500 36.70368 -1.219512
    key = 15.65 485 -3.517569 -16.3017
    key = 52.3 100 -3.71531 -15.77211
    key = 53.64 0
}

Curve begins at 0 0

    key = 0 250

dataPoint 0 - Torque has jumps to 250 and increases to 1st dataPoint.  50% torque at 0m/s

    key = 3.35 500 36.70368 -1.219512

dataPoint1- Torque at 3.35m/s has ramped-up to 500.  Curve enters dataPoint1 at 36.70368 degrees and exits dataPoint1 at -1.219512 degrees.  Decreasing to dataPoint2.

	key = 15.65 485 -3.517569 -16.3017

dataPoint2 - Torque at 15.65m/s has decreased to 485. Curve enters dataPoint2 at -3.517569 degrees and exits dataPoint2 at -16.3017 degrees. Decreasing to dataPoint3.

    key = 52.3 100 -3.71531 -15.77211

dataPoint3 - Torque at 52.3m/s has decreased to 100. Curve enters dataPoint at -3.71531 degrees and exits at -15.77211 degrees. Decreasing to dataPoint4. 

(Note: The entry and exit angles between dataPoints 2 and 3 create a convex parabola.)

    key = 53.64 0

dataPoint4 - Torque at 53.64m/s has decreased to 0. This is the termination of the curve.
